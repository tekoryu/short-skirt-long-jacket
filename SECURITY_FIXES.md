# Security Fixes and Improvements Applied

This document summarizes all the security fixes and improvements applied to the codebase.

## üö® CRITICAL FIXES

### 1. Environment File Security
**Issue:** The `.env` file was tracked in git, potentially exposing secrets in version control history.

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **MANUAL ACTION REQUIRED**

**Action Required:**
```bash
# 1. Remove .env from git tracking (already in .gitignore but was committed)
git rm --cached .env
git commit -m "Remove .env from version control"

# 2. Check if repository has been pushed to remote
git remote -v

# 3. If pushed, rotate ALL secrets immediately:
#    - Generate new SECRET_KEY
#    - Change database passwords
#    - Update all credentials
#    - Consider using tools like git-filter-repo to remove from history if needed

# 4. Never commit .env files again - use .env.example as template
```

### 2. Production Security Settings
**Fixed in:** `app/config/settings.py`

Added comprehensive security settings:
- `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT` - Forces HTTPS in production
- `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` - Secure cookies over HTTPS only
- `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE` - CSRF cookies over HTTPS only
- `SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER` - XSS protection
- `SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF` - Prevents MIME sniffing
- `X_FRAME_OPTIONS = 'DENY'` - Clickjacking protection
- `SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS = 31536000` - 1 year HSTS in production
- `SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY` - Prevents JavaScript access to session cookies
- `CSRF_COOKIE_HTTPONLY` - Prevents JavaScript access to CSRF tokens

### 3. Hardcoded Proxy Removed
**Fixed in:** `Dockerfile`, `compose.yaml`, `.env.example`

**Changes:**
- Proxy configuration now uses build arguments
- Set `USE_PROXY=true` in `.env` when you need proxy during development
- Set `HTTP_PROXY_URL` to your proxy address
- Proxy is disabled by default for portability

**Usage:**
```bash
# In your .env file for development with proxy:
USE_PROXY=true
HTTP_PROXY_URL=http://10.1.101.101:8080

# For production or environments without proxy:
USE_PROXY=false
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH PRIORITY FIXES

### 4. Code Bugs Fixed
**Fixed in:** `app/apps/cities/views.py`

**Issues Fixed:**
- Changed `City.objects.all()` ‚Üí `Municipality.objects.all()` (undefined model)
- Fixed field references to use actual model structure with proper relationships
- Added `select_related()` for query optimization
- Used related state via ForeignKey chain instead of non-existent fields

### 5. IP Spoofing Prevention
**Fixed in:** `app/apps/auth/views.py:348`, `app/apps/auth/mixins.py:106`

**Changes:**
- `get_client_ip()` now validates `X-Forwarded-For` header
- Filters out private/loopback IPs to prevent spoofing
- Uses rightmost public IP from the chain
- Audit logs now have more reliable IP addresses

### 6. Rate Limiting Implemented
**Fixed in:** `app/apps/auth/views.py`

**Protection Added:**
- Login endpoint: 5 attempts per 5 minutes per IP (prevents brute force)
- Registration endpoint: 3 registrations per hour per IP (prevents spam)
- Uses `django-ratelimit` library (added to requirements.txt)

### 7. Excessive Logging Reduced
**Fixed in:** `app/apps/auth/mixins.py`

**Changes:**
- Successful permission checks now only log to application logs (DEBUG level)
- Database logs only capture access denials for security auditing
- Prevents database bloat from millions of successful access records
- Maintains security audit trail for denied access attempts

### 8. Dependencies Pinned
**Fixed in:** `requirements.txt`

**Pinned versions:**
```
pandas==2.2.3
openpyxl==3.1.5
xlrd==2.0.1
django-ratelimit==4.1.0
```

## ‚ö° MEDIUM PRIORITY FIXES

### 9. Database Connection Pooling
**Fixed in:** `app/config/settings.py`

**Added:**
- `CONN_MAX_AGE = 600` - Keeps connections alive for 10 minutes
- `connect_timeout = 10` - Prevents hanging connections
- Improves performance under load

### 10. Gunicorn Configuration
**Fixed in:** `scripts/run.sh`

**Production settings:**
- 4 workers (adjust based on CPU cores)
- 60 second timeout
- Sync worker class
- Max 1000 requests per worker (prevents memory leaks)
- Request jitter to prevent thundering herd
- Proper logging to stdout/stderr

### 11. Structured Logging
**Fixed in:** `app/config/settings.py`, `Dockerfile`

**Added:**
- Rotating file handlers (15MB per file, 10 backups)
- Separate security log file (`/vol/web/logs/security.log`)
- General Django log file (`/vol/web/logs/django.log`)
- Console output with verbose formatting
- Log directory created in Docker: `/vol/web/logs/`

### 12. Database Port Exposure
**Fixed in:** `compose.yaml`

**Changed:**
- PostgreSQL port 5432 no longer exposed to host by default
- Commented out with instructions
- Uncomment only if you need direct database access from host
- Improves security by limiting attack surface

## üìù LOW PRIORITY FIXES

### 13. Unused Import Removed
**Fixed in:** `app/apps/auth/mixins.py`

Removed unused imports:
- `django.views.decorators.csrf.csrf_exempt`
- `django.utils.decorators.method_decorator`
- `django.contrib.auth.decorators.login_required`
- `functools.wraps`

## üìã TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS

After applying these fixes, test the following:

1. **Build and start containers:**
   ```bash
   docker compose down -v
   docker compose build
   docker compose up
   ```

2. **Test login rate limiting:**
   - Try logging in with wrong password 6 times
   - Should be blocked after 5 attempts
   - Wait 5 minutes and try again

3. **Test registration rate limiting:**
   - Try registering 4 accounts in quick succession
   - Should be blocked after 3 attempts

4. **Verify security headers (in production with DEBUG=False):**
   ```bash
   curl -I https://yourdomain.com
   # Check for:
   # X-Frame-Options: DENY
   # X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
   # Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000
   ```

5. **Check logs:**
   ```bash
   docker compose exec app ls -la /vol/web/logs/
   # Should see django.log and security.log files
   ```

6. **Test permission system:**
   - Login and access restricted resources
   - Verify only access denials appear in PermissionLog table
   - Check application logs for successful access (DEBUG level)

## üîí SECURITY CHECKLIST FOR PRODUCTION

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Generate a strong SECRET_KEY (use `python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"`)
- [ ] Set `DEBUG=False` in production .env
- [ ] Use strong database passwords (16+ characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
- [ ] Set proper `ALLOWED_HOSTS` for your domain
- [ ] Remove .env from git history if it was ever committed
- [ ] Rotate all secrets if repository was ever public
- [ ] Set up SSL/TLS certificates (Let's Encrypt, etc.)
- [ ] Configure firewall to only allow necessary ports
- [ ] Set up regular database backups
- [ ] Configure log rotation and monitoring
- [ ] Review and adjust rate limits based on your traffic patterns
- [ ] Consider adding django-axes for more sophisticated login protection
- [ ] Set up monitoring/alerting for security logs
- [ ] Review HSTS settings and ensure you're ready for HTTPS-only

## üìö Additional Recommendations

### Not Implemented (But Recommended)

1. **Email Verification Flow**
   - `User.is_verified` field exists but no verification flow
   - Consider implementing email verification for new registrations

2. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
   - High-value government system should consider 2FA
   - Libraries: `django-otp`, `django-two-factor-auth`

3. **Comprehensive Test Suite**
   - Test files are empty
   - Critical for security-sensitive government application
   - Test authentication, permissions, rate limiting

4. **CORS Configuration**
   - If you'll have frontend on different domain
   - Use `django-cors-headers`

5. **API Authentication**
   - If exposing APIs to external consumers
   - Consider Django REST Framework with token auth

6. **Database Encryption**
   - Consider encrypting sensitive fields at rest
   - Library: `django-encrypted-model-fields`

7. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**
   - Add `django-csp` for additional XSS protection
   - Define strict CSP headers

8. **Security Scanning**
   - Run `pip install safety` and check for vulnerable dependencies
   - Use `bandit` for Python code security scanning
   - Consider SAST/DAST tools for continuous security testing

## üÜò Support

If you encounter issues with any of these changes:

1. Check Docker logs: `docker compose logs -f app`
2. Check security log: `docker compose exec app cat /vol/web/logs/security.log`
3. Check Django log: `docker compose exec app cat /vol/web/logs/django.log`
